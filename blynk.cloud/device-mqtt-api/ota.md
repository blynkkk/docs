# OTA

## OTA package notification

To indicate it's current software/firmware version, the device publishes [`Firmware and Device Info`](authentication.md#firmware-and-device-info) message. The server then evaluates whether an update is necessary and, if so, publishes a message on the **downlink/ota/json** topic:

```json
{
    "url": "https://blynk.cloud/static/file.tar.gz?token=jOuWQWu_bOANvBPzz4LllPDMk7sYAAQMa",
    "size": 20082,
    "type": "TMPLabcd1234",
    "ver": "0.5.0",
    "build": "Mar 05 2024 18:29:27"
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This message can also be delivered at any time during the device operation, i.e. when Blynk.Air shipment is created or when the `Preferred Time` condition is met.
{% endhint %}

The device must verify whether the update is feasible and then download the OTA package using `HTTP`/`HTTPS`. Additionally, the HTTP Response Headers provide valuable information:

* `x-sha256` - Base64-encoded SHA256 digest of the OTA package
* `x-md5`- HEX-encoded MD5 digest of the OTA package
* `x-fw-type` - The firmware type
* `x-fw-ver` - The firmware version string
* `x-fw-build` - The firmware build time

{% hint style="info" %}
`type`, `ver`, `build` fields are available only if Blynk.Cloud can extract this information (stored as a binary info tag) from the uploaded OTA package file.
{% endhint %}

After installing the update, the device re-connects to Blynk.Cloud and publishes the updated [`Firmware and Device Info`](authentication.md#firmware-and-device-info) message.

```bash
mosquitto_sub -h blynk.cloud -p 8883 -u device -P '{DEVICE_TOKEN}' -t 'downlink/ota/json'
```
