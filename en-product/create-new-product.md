# What is a Product



Product is an essential part of Blynk platform. It's a digital description of the device. Think about the product as a template that can be inherited by devices that serve the same function. For example, if you manufacture 2 types of different products: smart bulb and temperature sensor. Then you would need to create 2 Products.

Every Product has a unique Product ID \(template ID\)"
