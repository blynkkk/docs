# Mobile Dashboard Editor

The primary function of Developer Mode in the mobile app is to build and edit the Mobile Dashboard User interface \(GUI\) for the given Device Template.

Mobile Dashboard is built from Widgets - modular UI elements which can be positioned on the canvas. Every Widget serves a special function \(a button, a slider, a chart, etc\). Every Widget has it's own settings based on its functionality

### **How to enable Developer Mode**

1. In the Blynk.app or in Blynk.360
2. Navigate to **My Profile** / **User profile** in the left menu
3. Check that **Developer Mode** switch is set to ON

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently, **only one developer is allowed per Organization** to avoid sync issues. This limit can be changed later.
{% endhint %}

If you don't have any Device Templates, you can create a basic template in the app and then fully set it up in Blynk.360 later

When there is a Device Template already, you can tap on it and start working with mobild dashboard layout.
