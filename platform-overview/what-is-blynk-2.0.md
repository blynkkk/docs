Blynk is a [multi-tenant](multi-tenant-tree-structure.md) solution. You can configure how users get access to the data by setting roles and configuring permissions.

Applications made with Blynk are ready for the end-users. Whether this is your family member, employee, or someone who has purchased your product, they will be able to download the app, connect the device and start using it.
