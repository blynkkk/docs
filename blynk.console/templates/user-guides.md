# User Guides

By default, all devices use the same provisioning/claiming instructions, but occasionally, the device may require a specific Installation Guide, Troubleshooting link or Device Preparation Instructions. You can set them up for each Template separately:

1. Go to Template
2. Open the User Guides tab
3. Click on the item you’d like to modify

_You can reset the Guides to default by clicking the Reset To Default button_.

To ensure your guide is clear and well-structured, we support Markdown syntax. Below are the essential Markdown elements you can use:

#### **Headlines**

* Use **Headlines** to structure your guide into individual steps.
* Start each main step with an H1 headline (`#`).
* For sub-steps, use H2 (`##`) and H3 (`###`) headlines.

**Example:**

```
# Step 1: Unbox the Device
## Step 1.1: Check the Contents
## Step 1.2: Inspect the Device

# Step 2: Power On the Device
```

#### **Lists**

* Use **Ordered Lists** for steps that must follow a specific order.
* Use **Unordered Lists** for items that do not require a particular order.

**Example:**

```
# Step 3: Connect the Device

1. Plug in the power cable.
2. Connect the device to your Wi-Fi network.
    - Ensure your Wi-Fi is on.
    - Enter the Wi-Fi password when prompted.
3. Wait for the device to sync.

#### **Links**
