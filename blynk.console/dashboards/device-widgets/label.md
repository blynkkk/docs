# Label

The Label widget provides a clear, aggregated view of important data from single or multiple devices.

By combining data from multiple devices, the Label widget helps you make informed decisions. It is useful in many cases such as:

**Construction**: Display the total energy consumption of a building by aggregating data from all smart meters and sensors.

**Agriculture**: Show the average humidity level across multiple greenhouses to ensure optimal growing conditions.

**Manufacturing**: Present the total output or efficiency rate of production lines by aggregating data from various machines and sensors.

**Smart Homes**: Display the overall air quality index by combining readings from multiple air quality sensors throughout the house.



#### **How to configure**:

1. Select datastreams.
2. Choose aggregation type. You can choose Average, Min, Max, Sum, or Latest value (only if 1 device selected).
3. Narrow down device selection (optional).
4. Design. Navigate to Design tab to configure options such as Background color, Level, and Content Alignment.

4. Open Advanced Settings.
5. Turn on the Enable history data.
