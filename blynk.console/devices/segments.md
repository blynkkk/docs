# Segments

### Overview

Segments allow you to organize dynamic or static lists of devices based on certain parameters (filters) or manual selection. There are two types of segments: static and dynamic.

#### Static Segment

A static segment consists of a manual selection of devices. It remains unchanged unless manually updated.

**How to Create a Static Segment:**

1. Select multiple devices or users.
2. Use the **Add to Segment** option from the **Bulk Actions** menu.

#### Dynamic Segment

A dynamic segment automatically updates based on filters. Any new device that matches the filter criteria will be added to the segment automatically.

**How to Create a Dynamic Segment:**

1. Apply filters in the **All** Segment view to refine your device list.
2. Click the **Save as Segment** button near the filter setup.

### Managing Segments

#### Accessing Segment Actions

To manage segment actions:

1. Select the desired segment.
2. Click the three-dot icon next to the segment name.
3. A list of available actions will appear.

#### Static Segment Actions

For static segments, you can:

* **Rename** the segment.
* **Delete** the segment.
* **Exclude specific devices:** To exclude a device, either open the table actions for the specific row or select multiple rows and use the bulk actions.

#### Dynamic Segment Actions

For dynamic segments, you can:

* **Rename** the segment.
* **Delete** the segment.
* **Edit Filters** to modify the criteria that define the segment.

### Reordering the Segments

You can change the order of segments using the **Segments Menu**:

1. Open the **Segments Menu** located near the last segment.
2. Drag and drop segments to the desired position.

_Note: The first segment in the list will always be opened by default._

### Limitations

* Segments are available in **PRO** and **Enterprise** plans.
* Segments are saved at the organization level.
* Maximum segment name length: 40 characters.
* Maximum number of segments: 50.
